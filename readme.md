Statiks
========

Statiks is a mobile application for iPhone propulsed thanks to [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) allowing you to connect several social networks and retrieve your details stats.
You can reload your networks and consult for each network how many followers you gained (or lost) through dynamic graph.

I keep improving, fixing, adding new networks and more stats. Feel free to contribute.
